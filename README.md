#### Important Notes
###### _API Credentials_
We use the API credentials provided to us by booking.com to access the APIs. 
These credentials are stored inside `.env` file in two variables: `REACT_APP_BOOKING_AUTH_USERNAME` and `REACT_APP_BOOKING_AUTH_PASSWORD`. We understand that if our access is revoked to the APIs that our API requests will return 401. If this happens, please replace the values of `REACT_APP_BOOKING_AUTH_USERNAME` and `REACT_APP_BOOKING_AUTH_PASSWORD` inside `.env` with valid API credentials.
